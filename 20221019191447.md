# 2. Building a Guessing Game

#### #use
```rust
use std::io;
```
Pulls `std` into scope. #std is the standard #io/#input-output library. 
Rust has a defined standard library called a #prelude. [View the entire prelude.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html)
If you want to use something that **isn't in the prelude** you must bring it into scope explicitly with the `use` keyword.

#### #fn
`fn main()` declares a function with no parameters. 

####  #println
`println!("Hello, World!");` #macro that prints a string to the output.

`println!("Hello, {name}");` will print text to the screen like last time. However, `{name}` is a #placeholder and will be replaced in the final output.

You can use more than one placeholder. You can also mix types. Consider the following example:
```rust
let firstName = "Jordan";
let awesomenessScore = 100;

println!("Hello, {firstName}. I have calculated you are {awesomenessScore}% awesome!");
```

#### #let
`let apples = 5` creates a new variable called `apples` and binds it to `5`.

#variable's in rust are #immutable by default. This means once a variable has a value, it will not change. 

`let mut guess = String::new();` creates a new #mutable #variable called `guess` and binds it to a new #instance of #string. The #mut keyword is what allows the variable to be mutable.

#### #comment
`// This is a comment and will not run` double slashes are used to make a comment

#### #string
A [string](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a string type provides by the standard library and is #growable, #UTF-8 encoded text.

#### #stdin
When imported with `use std::io;` you can use the `stdin` function from the `io` #module.
If not imported, you can still use `stdin` by providing the full namespace. `std::io::stdin`
The `stdin` function returns an instance of `std::io:Stdin`. It is a type which represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.

```rust
io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)
```
Calls the read_line #method on the standard input handle to get input from the user. `&mut guess` is passed as an argument to `read_line` to tell it what string to store the user input in. read_line **will not** overwrite the contents of the string. Additionally, the string must be _mutable_ so that the method can change the strings content.

`read_line` returns a #Result ([Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html)) value as an #enumeration or often called #enum ([Enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html)). Result's variants are `Ok` and `Err`. The `Ok` variable indicates the operation was successful. The `Err` variant means the operation failed. 

####  #ampersand(&) or #references
The `&` indicates an argument is a reference. This allows multiple parts of code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times.

references are #immutable by default. 

#### #expect
```rust
.expect("Failed to read line");
```

####  #randcrate
#crate
Rust does not include a random number generator in the prelude. However, this is an available #rand [#crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand) that does provide this functionality. 

In order to use this crate, modify your #cargotoml. Under the `[dependencies]` heading add `rand = "0.8.3"`

#### #rand
#externalcreates
```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
}
```

The `Rng` (#Rng) #trait defines methods that random numbers generators implement and must be in scope for us to use those methods.
The `rand::thread_rng()` function will give us a particular random number generator. It will be local to the current #thread of execution and seeded by the operating system.

The `gen_range` method will take a range expression as an argument and generate a random number within that range. It follows the format `start..=end` and is inclusive on the lower an bounds. Therefore, in our example any number between and including 1 and 100 can be selected.

#### #Result and #expect
[Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html)
Values of result type, like many values of any type have methods defined on them. An instance of _Result_ has an `expect` [method](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect) that can be called. If the instance of _Result_ is an `Err` value, `expect` will cause the project to crash and display the message that was passed to the `expect` method. If expect is not called, the program will compile but will generate a #warning.  

A _Result_ can be matched.
```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };
```
If guess is a number, the first arm will be matched. If not, it will compare the `Err(_)` where the underscore is #catchall value. It will match the `Err` variant regardless of the value. 


#### Cargo.lock or #cargolock
Like package.lock, cargo.lock is a file that will ensure everyone with the file builds with the same artifacts.

#### `cargo update` or #cargoupdate
By running `cargo update` cargo will ignore the #cargolock file and figure out the latest versions that fit your specs in the #cargotoml file. 

#### #ordering 
```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering
```
Brings `Ordering` in from the standard library. The `Ordering` type is another enum and has the variants Less, Greater, and Equal.

#### #cmp
`string.cmp` compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare.

In the following example this is comparing the variable guess to the variable secret number.
```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```

#### #match
In the following example [`match`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html) expression will decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering was returned from the call to #cmp.
```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```

A match expression is made up of #arms. An arm consists of a pattern to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to match fits that arm's pattern. Patterns and the match construct are powerful Rust features that let you express a variety of situations your code might encounter and ensures you handle them all. 

#### #type
Rust has a strong static type system. However, it also has type interference. When writing `let mut guess = String::new()` rust was able to infer that guess should be string and didn't make us write the type. 

#i32: A 32 bit number
#u32: An unsigned 32-bit number
#i64: A 64-bit number

Unless otherwise specified rust will default to #i32.  

#### #casting
`let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number");` will cast the _String_ `guess` into a unsigned 32-bit number.


#### #shadow
Rust allows us to _shadow_ a previous value with a new one.
```
let mut guess = String::new();

io::stdin()
	.read_line(&mut guess)
	.expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

#### #associatedfunctions
An _associated function_ is a function that's implemented on a type.
In the following code, `new` is an _associated_ function of the String type. 
```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

#### loop
The loop keyword creates an infinite loop. (similar to a while (true)). 

```rust
loop {
	println!("In a loop forever!");
}
```

You can use a #break statement to end the loop. 
```rust
loop {
	println!("I will only print once.")
	break;
}
```


### Final Code
The final code of the first #project

`src/main.rs`
```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;


fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    println!("Please input your guess.");
    
    loop {
        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {guess}");

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        };
    }
}
