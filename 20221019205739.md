# 3.1 Variables and Mutability

```rust
let x = 5;
println!("The value of x is: {x}");
x = 6;
println!("The value of x is: {x}");
```
Will throw an error
```
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src\main.rs:8:5

6 |     let x = 5;
  |         -

7 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
8 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

Errors are not a sign of a bad programmer, but instead they are designed to help you find the problem. 

By adding the `mut` keyword to the first declaration of `x` we allow the variable to be muted and no longer encounter errors. 

```rust
let mut x = 5;
println!("The value of x is: {x}");
x = 6;
println!("The value of x is: {x}");
```

#### #constant 
Like #immutable variables, constants are values that are bound to a name and **can not** be changed. But there are a few key differences. 
You **can not** use the #mut keyword with constants. In contrast to variables in which are immutable by default, constant variables are **ALWAYS** immutable. 

In the following example we declare a constant variable. When declaring a constant variable you **MUST** also declare the Data Type. 
```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

Rust code style(#codestyle) is to use all uppercase with underscores as constant variables name. Rust is able to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time. See the [Rust Referenceâ€™s section on constant evaluation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/const_eval.html) for more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.


#### #shadowing in depth
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. #Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second. Meaning, the first second variable is what the #compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. 

```rust
let x = 5;

let x = x + 1;

{
	let x = x * 2;
	println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
}

println!("The value of x is: {x}");
```
In the previous example the program first binds `x` to 5. Then it creates a new variable by repeating `x + 1`. Therefore, the value of `x` is 6. Then within the inner #scope of that is created by the curly braces the third `let` statement shadows `x` again to create a new variable which multiplies the previous value by 2 and gives `x` a value of _12_. 

Shadowing is different than allowing a variable to be mutated via the #mut keyword. The other difference between `mut` and is allowing us to effectively create a new variable. 

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```
In the previous example we were spared from having to come up with a separate variable name.
