# 13. Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures

### Closures
A #closure is an anonymous function that can be saved as a variable or passed as an argument to other functions.

You can type of a closure if you would like to be more verbose than strictly necessary.
```rust
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
	println!("calculating slowly...");
	thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
	num
};
```

The following are valid valid ways of writing a function or closure
```rust
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 } // Function
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 }; // Typed closure
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 }; // Untyped closure
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ; // Untyped closure without brackets because the body has a single expression
```

During compile time, a closure is given a concrete type. If you then use it with a different type it will throw an error.
```rust
let example_closure = |x| x;

let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
// error[E0308]: mismatched types
let n = example_closure(5);
|                       ^- help: try using a conversion method: `.to_string()`
|                       |
|                       expected struct `String`, found integer

```

A closure can capture a value from their environment in three ways which map directly to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing immutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closer decides this based on what the body of the function is doing with the captured value.

The following borrows immutably because it only prints a value
```rust
let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {:?}", list);

println!("Before calling closure: {:?}", list);
only_borrows();
println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
```

This code snippet borrows mutably because the variable is changed.
```rust
let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);

borrows_mutably();
println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
```

> **_NOTE ℹ️:_** We can no longer use `list` between the definition and and call because it was borrowed by the definition

If you want to force a closure to take ownership even if it doesn't strictly need it, you can use the #move keyword. This is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new #thread to move that data into the new thread.
```rust
let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

thread::spawn(move || println!("From thread: {:?}", list))
	.join()
	.unwrap();
```

#### Moving captured values out of closures and the #fntrait
A closure can move a captured value out of a closure, mutate the captured value, neither move nor mutuate the value, or capture nothing from the environment to being with.

1. `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement at least this trait, because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement FnOnce and none of the other Fn traits, because it can only be called once.
2. `FnMut` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.
3. `Fn` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body and that don’t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.

### Iterators
The #iterator pattern allows you to preform some task on a sequence of items in turn. In Rust, iterators are _lazy_, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that use the iterator up.

By itself, this code does nothing useful.
```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v1_iter = v1.iter();
```

One method to consume it is to use the #for loop.
```rust
for val in v1_iter {
	println!("Got: {}", val);
}
```

All Iterators implement the #iteratortrait 
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
```

The trait only requires the implementation of a single method `next`. We can call this manually. However, we must make the iterator mutable as it changes internal state to keep track of where we are. An iterator eats up an item each time `next` is called. 
```rust
let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

println!("Value 1: {}", v1_iter.next());
println!("Value 2: {}", v1_iter.next());
```

> **_NOTE ℹ️:_** `Iter` returns immutable references to the values in the vector. In order to take ownership of v1 and return owned values use #into_iter instead. 

Some methods use up the iterator, like the `sum` method. You will be unable to use the iterator again.

#IteratorAdaptors on the other hand are methods defined on the Iterator trait that don't consume the iterator. They provude a different iterator by changing some aspects of the original iterator. In the following example, the #map method takes a closure to call on each item and returns a new iterator that produces the modified items.

```rust
let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
```
However, this will produce a warning, _iterators are lazy and do nothing unless consumed_. We can fix this by using the #collect which consumes and collects the results into a collection data type.

This function will take ownership of `shoes` and `shoe_size` parameters and then return a vector containing only shoes of a specific size. The body calls `into_iter` which creates an iterator that takes ownership of the vector. Next, filter is called to adapt that iterator into a new iterator that only contains elements for which the closure returns true. Finally, collect is called to gather the values returned by the iterator into a vector. 
```rust
fn shoes_in_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
	shoes.into_iter().filter(|s| s.size == shoe_size).collect()
}
```



### How to use closures to improve I/O project (See [minigrep.zip](code_exercises/minigrep.zip)) 
Consider the function
```rust
pub fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
	if args.len() < 3 {
		return Err("not enough arguments");
	}

	let query = args[1].clone();
	let file_path = args[2].clone();

	let ignore_case = env::var("IGNORE_CASE").is_ok();

	Ok(Config { query, file_path, ignore_case })
}
```

We can improve this function by having it take ownership of an iterator as it's argument instead of borrowing a slice. Then, we can use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length of the slice and index into specific locations. 

We then update the function:
```rust
impl Config {
    pub fn build(
        mut args: impl Iterator<Item = String>,
    ) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        args.next();

        let query = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) => arg,
            None => return Err("Didn't get a query string"),
        };

        let file_path = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) => arg,
            None => return Err("Didn't get a file path"),
        };

        let ignore_case = env::var("IGNORE_CASE").is_ok();

        Ok(Config {
            query,
            file_path,
            ignore_case,
        })
    }
}
```

We can update the search method using iterator methods
```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```
to
```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    contents
        .lines()
        .filter(|line| line.contains(query))
        .collect()
}
```
