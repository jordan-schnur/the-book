# 4.1 What is Ownership?

#Ownership is a set of ruels that govern how a Rust program manages #memory. Rust uses a set of rules that govern ownership that the compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program will not compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it's running.


### Stack vs Heap
Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code at runtime. 

#### #stack
The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. Called the last in, first out approach. Adding data is called _pushing onto the stack_ whereas removing data is called _poping off the stack_. All data stored on the stack must have a known and fixed size. Data with an unknown size(Such as a #vector) must be stored on the heap  ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/LIFO.jpg)

#### #heap
When putting data on the heap you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough and then marks it as being used and finally returns a #pointer to the memory address. This process is called _allocating on the heap_ and is abbreviated as allocating.  


#### Differences
Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data. However, when allocating space on the heap it rquires much more work. Accessing data in the heap is slower than the stack because you must follow a pnter to get there.

### Ownership Rules

#### Each value in Rust has an _owner_.

#### There can only be one owner at a time.

#### When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable #scope
```rust
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```
When `s` comes into scope it's valid (curly brace) and remains valid until it exits scope.
#### String #type
There are two string types
One allocated pushed on the stack and another allocated from the heap. 
```rust
let s = String::from("hello"); // heap, mutable
let s = "hello" // stack, immutable
```

### Ways variables and Data interact: Move
```rust
let x  = 5; 
let y = x;
```
X is created and bounded to `5`. `y` when makes a copy of `x`. This works because both values are of a fixed size.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```
In this example, the string itself is not copied. Rather, the pointer, len, and capacity are #moved. Therefore, `s2` is stored in the stack. 
![](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-02.svg)
`s1` is now considered invalid and will generate an error when being used. `borrow of moved value: 's1'`

### Ways variables and data interact: clone
In order to do a _deep_ copy of a data we'll need to call the `clone` method. This will copy the heap data, and not just the stack data.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

### Ownership and Functions
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```
After passing `s` into takes_ownership `s` becomes unable to be used. 

However, there are two solutions. You can use `takes_ownership(&s)` to pass the pointer, or you can use `takes_ownership(s.clone())`. The latter is preferred if not modifying `s`.

`x` is not a problem because it is a value of known size. 


#### Return values and scope
Return values also transfer scope. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```
It would be annoying to have to return a variable back each time you pass it to a function. That is why references exist. 

#### #tuple
A tuple can bet returned like so
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```
