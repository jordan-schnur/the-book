# 4.1 What is Ownership?

#Ownership is a set of ruels that govern how a Rust program manages #memory. Rust uses a set of rules that govern ownership that the compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program will not compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it's running.


### Stack vs Heap
Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code at runtime. 

#### #stack
The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. Called the last in, first out approach. Adding data is called _pushing onto the stack_ whereas removing data is called _poping off the stack_. All data stored on the stack must have a known and fixed size. Data with an unknown size(Such as a #vector) must be stored on the heap  ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/LIFO.jpg)

#### #heap
When putting data on the heap you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough and then marks it as being used and finally returns a #pointer to the memory address. This process is called _allocating on the heap_ and is abbreviated as allocating.  


#### Differences
Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data. However, when allocating space on the heap it rquires much more work. Accessing data in the heap is slower than the stack because you must follow a pnter to get there.

### Ownership Rules

#### Each value in Rust has an _owner_.

#### There can only be one owner at a time.

#### When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable #scope
```rust
    {                      // s is not valid here, itâ€™s not yet declared
        let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```
When `s` comes into scope it's valid (curly brace) and remains valid until it exits scope.
#### String #type
There are two string types
One allocated pushed on the stack and another allocated from the heap. 
```rust
let s = String::from("hello"); // heap, mutable
let s = "hello" // stack, immutable
```

### #clone
In order to do a _deep_ copy of a data we'll need to call the `clone` method.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```
