# 4.2 References and Borrowing

#### #reference
When calling a function the value is _moved_ into that function. Therefore, you would always have to return the value in order for it to remain valid. 
You can get around this problem by using _references_. A #reference is like a pointer, except it is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference. 

Consider the following example
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
In the example `s1` is created and then passed to `calculate_length` as a **reference**. `calculate_length` then returns the length of `s` without taking #ownership of `s`. Moreover, `calculate_length` does not have #ownership of `s` and thus will not be dropped.
![](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl04-05.svg)
The action of creating a _reference_ is called #borrowing. As in real life when you borrow something you give it back. You **do not** own it. 

If you were to try to modify the _reference_ it would throw a `cannot borrow '*some_string' as mutable, as it is behind a '&' reference` exception.
```rust
7 | fn change(some_string: &String) {
  |                        ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut String`
8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `some_string` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable

```


####  #mutablereference
By adding the #mut keyword to a #reference you create a _mutable reference_. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
Because we added the `mut` keyword to the `change` functions parameter of `some_string: &String` we can mutate this. 

> **_WARNING ⚠️:_** Mutating a reference comes with a big restriction. You can have only **1** reference to that value at any time. 

This code will fail
```rust
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 | 
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here
```

The benefit of having this restriction is avoiding race condition which can happen when three behaviors occur:  
1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
2. At least one pointer is being used to write to the data.
3. There's no mechanism being used to synchronize the data. 


#### #scope
Curly braces can **always** be used to define a new scope. In the case of multiple references:
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

In the following example there is not a problem because a #references scope begins where it is declared and ends at the final point it is used.
```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
```

Because `r1` and `r2` end at the first `println!` macro `r3` is allowed to create a mutable _reference_ to `s`.

####  #danglingreferences
Rust will not allow you to create a #pointer than is references memory that is given to another piece of code. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```
In the previous code we encounter an error because `dangle` created a new string `s` and then returned a #reference to that code. `s` goes out of scope when `dangle` finishes. 

To fix the problem simply return `s` instead of a reference of `s`.
