# 1.3 Hello, #Cargo!

`cargo` is a package manager for rust. In a similar vain to `npm` or `pip`. 

### Creating a new project
You can create a #newproject with the command `cargo new project_name` where project name is the name of the project you want to create. You can then `cd` into the new directory. 


#### Cargo.toml or #cargotoml
The `cargo.toml` file is broken down into sections using the format `[sectionname`. The formatting is [Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language](https://toml.io/) format. 

```
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

A #dependency is called a #crate in Rust. 

Cargo follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) or #SemVer. If you added `rand = "0.8.3"` to the dependencies it would be shorthand for `^0.8.3`. This would allow any version that is at least `0.8.3` but below `0.9.0`.

When including external dependencies, Cargo will fetch the latest versions of everything that the dependency needs from the #registry. Which is a copy of data from https://crates.io/.


#### Project Structure
- src
	- main.rs
- Cargo.toml
- Cargo.lock

Cargo expects code to live in the `src` directory and a `Cargo.toml` to be in the project root directory. 


### #Building and Running a Cargo project

`cargo build` will build the project for a current target. The resulting #executable will be available in `target/debug/project_name`. #cargobuild

`cargo run` will build and run the resulting executable. #cargorun

`cargo check` will quickly check your code to ensure it will compile without actually producing an executable. #cargocheck

`cargo build --release` will compile your code with optimizations. The optimizations will make your code run faster, but will require more time to compile. #cargobuildrelease

`cargo doc --open` will document all current Crates in a project and open a web browser where you can view the documentation. #cratedoc
