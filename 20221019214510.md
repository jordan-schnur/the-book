# 3.3 Functions

### #fn
A function is declared via the `fn` keyword. It is followed by parenthesis that define the functions parameters. Finally, it is followed by curly braces that define the function body.  


#### #parameter
A functions parameters are defined within the parenthesis and are called #arguments.
```rust
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

You **must** declare the type of each parameter. 

### Statements vs Expressions

#statements are instructions that preform some action and **do not** return a value.
#expressions evaluate to a resulting value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```
In this example the `let` keyword is a _statement_. Function definitions are also statements.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
	//       ^^^^^^^^^
	//= note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement
}
```


```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

The expression is 
```rust
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```
where in this case it would evaluate to 4. Expressions **do not** include semicolons. 


#### #function's with #returnvalues 
Functions can return values, but they are not named. We must declare the type with the `->` #arrow. 

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
The `five` function returns 5 with no semicolon because it's an expression whose value we want to return. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```
If you added a semicolon to `x + 1` this would result in an `implicitly returns () as its body has no tail or return expression` error.
