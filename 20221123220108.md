# 7. Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates and Modules

As a Rust project grows in scale good project organization will be an increasingly import role.
A _package_ can contain multiple _binary crates_ and an optional _library crate_. As a _package_ grows, you can extract it into separate creates that become external dependencies. 

A _scope_ is the nested context in which code is written and contains, variables, functions, structs etc… You can create scopes and change which names are in/out of scope. However, two items can **not** share the same name in the same scope.



* **#Modules** and **use:** Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
* **#Paths:** A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

## Packages and crates
A **#crate:** A tree of modules that produces a library or executable

A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at one time. Crates can come in two forms, a _binary crate_ and a _library crate_.


### Binary Crates
A #BinaryCrate is a program you can compile and execute such as a cli or server. 
Each must contain a function called `main` that defines what happens when the program is run.

### Library Crates
A #LibraryCrate does **not** have a `main` function and does not compile into an executable. Rather, it defines functionality that is shared with multiple projects. An example is `rand` that we used in Chapter 2.

### Crate Root
A #crateroot is a source file that Rust starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.

### Package
**Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
A #package is a bundle of one or many crates that provide functionality. It must contain a #cargotoml file that describes how to build those crates. A package can contain any number of binary crates, but must contain no more than a single library crate. However, a package must contain at least one library or binary crate.

In the generated `cargo.toml` after creating a new project you will notice that it does not make reference to the `src/main.rs` file.  This is a convention for where the `main` function is defined. If the file is instead `src/lib.rs` cargo will know it is actually a library crate. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the `src/bin` directory and each file will be a separate binary crate. 

### Path
A #path can take two forms
* An _absolute path_ starts from the literal `crate` and is followed by the full path string
* A _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super` or an identifier in the current module. 

### Scope and Privacy

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

Looks like
```rust
crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
```

A module can't use the private items inside a child module, but items in a child module can use items in their ancestor modules. Modules items are private by default. 

### Public keyword
Using the #pub keyword on a module does not make the contents public. They will remain private.

Using the #pub keyword on a struct will not make the fields public. However, doing so on an #enum will make all it's variants public. 


Using the #super keyword allows you to use relative pathing between modules. 

See Rust API Guidelines for how to manage your public API. https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/

### Use keyword
The #use keyword avoids repetitive code by bring a path into scope without having to repeat the full path over and over.

Use statements are only in the scope they are declared in. 

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

Would throw an error due to hosting not being in the scope of `eat_at_restaurant()`.

By bring `hosting` into scope **instead of** `add_to_waitlist` we are using the _idiomatic way_ of bring it into scope. This makes clear `add_to_waitlist` is not locally defined. 

On the other hand it is idomatic to specify the fully path when using structs, enums, and other items with use. There is no strong reason to do this, however it is the standard that has emerged in Rust.

If two types have the same name you can use the #as keyword, or _alias_ for the type.

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

When bringing a name into scope with the `use` keyword the name will be private. We can combine #pub and #use to allow others in the codes scope to use it. This is called #re-exporting because we're bringing an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into their scope. This is useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. 

External packages are added to the Cargo.toml file by declaring them in the [dependencies] block.

If using multiple items from the same crate or module you can lsit them inline. 
This
```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
```
Becomes this
`use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};`

If you want to bring everything from a path into scope you can use the #glob operator. This brings all public items into scope.
```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

### Separating modules into files
To extract a root module, name the file `name_of_module.rs`. An example is `mod front_of_house` would become `front_of_house.rs`. 

To add a module called `hosting` inside `front_of_house` you would put a file called `hosting.rs` inside of `/src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`.


## #Module cheat sheet
Copied verbatim from the book. [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet)

Here we provide a quick reference on how modules, paths, the `use` keyword, and the `pub` keyword work in the compiler, and how most developers organize their code. We’ll be going through examples of each of these rules throughout this chapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules work.

* **Start from the crate root**: When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file (usually _src/lib.rs_ for a library crate or _src/main.rs_ for a binary crate) for code to compile.
* **Declaring modules**: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules; say, you declare a “garden” module with `mod garden;`. The compiler will look for the module’s code in these places:
    * Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod garden`
    * In the file _src/garden.rs_
    * In the file _src/garden/mod.rs_
* **Declaring submodules**: In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might declare `mod vegetables;` in _src/garden.rs_. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the directory named for the parent module in these places:
    * Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon
    * In the file _src/garden/vegetables.rs_
    * In the file _src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs_
* **Paths to code in modules**: Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an `Asparagus` type in the garden vegetables module would be found at `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`.
* **Private vs public**: Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with `pub mod` instead of `mod`. To make items within a public module public as well, use `pub` before their declarations.
* **The `use` keyword**: Within a scope, the `use` keyword creates shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`, you can create a shortcut with `use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;` and from then on you only need to write `Asparagus` to make use of that type in the scope.
