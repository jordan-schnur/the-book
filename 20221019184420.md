# Hello, World!

You can #compile a program by running `rustc main.rs` where `main.rs` is the file containing the `main` function.

### Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
`main` is a special function and is always the first code called. `main` has no parameters and returns nothing. Rust requires all functions to be wrapped in `{}` curly braces. It's good #codestyle to place the curly brace on the same line as the function declaration.


**Note:** A tool called #rustfmt can be used to enforce #codestyle. It is included in `rustc`
