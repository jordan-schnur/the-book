# 10. Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

## Generics to reduce code duplication
#generic's allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that represents multiple types. It's main purpose is reducing code duplication. 

These two functions do that same thing:
```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
```

We can use generics to abstract this to
```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
```

However, this will encounter an error. error[E0369]: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `&T`. Meaning, the `>` operator can not be used on any type. We must use a #trait to limit this. `std:cmp::PartialOrd`.

This code will not compile and produce the results we expect.
```rust
fn largest<T: std::cmp::PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
```

### In struct's
We can also use generic's in #struct.
```rust
struct Point<T> {
	x: T,
	y: T,
}

fn main() {
	let integer = Point {x: 5, y: 10};
	let float = Point {x: 2.5, y: 7.5};
}
```

This will work because x and y are of the same type. However if you tried something like `let wont_work = Point {x: 5, y: 4.0}` this would encounter and error because `Point` is expecting `x` and `y` to be the same type. 

If there was a case for two different types, you can change the `Point` definition to use many generic types.
```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
	x: T,
	y: U,
}
```

### In enums
We have already seen how enums use generics with the #option enum. Recall
```rust
enum Option<T> {
	Some(T),
	None,
}

// We also saw them uses in Result
enum Result<T, E> {
	Ok(T),
	Err(E),
}
```

### In method def
```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

You can also use concrete types to define behavior for specific types. 
```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

The generic parameters don't always have to be the same as those used in the struct's method signatures either.
```rust
struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

### Performance considerations
Using generics causes no performance hit at runtime. Rust uses #monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time. It is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled. The compiler looks at all the places generics are used and fills in the data types accordingly. 

## Traits to define behavior in a generic way
A #trait defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. 
We can use #traitbounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has a certain behavior.

In the following code we declare a trait called `Summary` and then implement it on the `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` structs using the #impl keyword followed by the trait name and `for` `struct_name`. Therefore, you can call `.summerize()` on either a NewsArticle or Tweet and Rust will know how to handle it.
```rust
pub trait Summary { // Declare a trait called Summary that is public
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

> **_NOTE ℹ️:_** Crates that depend on the crate the trait was declared are allowed to implement the trait on their own types. Meaning, we could implement the Display trait on Tweet, but we could not implement `Display` on `Vec<T>` because both of these are external. This is called #coherence and avoids two crates implementing the same trait on the same type. 

Instead of leaving the Summary trait body empty, you can instead give it a default implementation. You can keep the body of `impl Summary` block empty
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}

impl Summary for Tweet {}
```

A default implementation can call other methods from a trait as well, even if the body is not defined.
```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}
```

### Traits as Parameters
The following function allows us to take only items that implement the Summary trait.
```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```
This is actually syntax sugar for `fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T)`. It is more verbose. However, using `&impl Summary` allows for multiple types.

We can use `fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {` to enforce multiple traits. We can do the same with generics `fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {`
### where Clauses
#where
To make a complex function signature easier to read you can use the where clause.
```rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```
becomes
```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
```

### Return types that implement traits
The following allows you to declare the return type of a function as a trait. This is especially useful in the context of #closures and #iterators
```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary
```

However, there is a limit to it. You can only use it if you are returning a single type.

You can use Trait Bounds to conditionally implement methods.
```rust
struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

We can also implement a trait for any type that implements another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds are called #blanketimplementations and are used extensively in Rust. 

```rust
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
```
The standard library implements the `ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. Because of this we can call `to_string` on any type that implements the `Display` trait.




## Lifetimes Generic
#lifetime ensures that a reference is valid as long as we need it to be. Every reference in Rust has a lifetime. The scope in which that reference is valid. The majority of the time they are implicit and inferred. Most languages do not have any sort of lifetime annotation and will feel unfamiliar. 

### Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes
The main purpose of lifetimes is to prevent #danglingreferences. These cause a program to reference data other than data it's intended to reference. 

Consider the following code: 
```rust
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x; // borrowed value does not live long enough 
    }

    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```
This code will error due to the value `r` is pointing to `x` going out of scope by the time r is used. That is to say `r` **_lives longer_** than `x`.
In this code, r has a scope of `'a` while x has a scope of `'b`.  `'b` ends at the closing curly brace, and  `'a` ends at the completion of `main`. 
The following code fixes it.
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                          //           |
    let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                          //   |       |
    println!("r: {}", r); //   |       |
                          // --+       |
}                         // ----------+
```

### Generic lifetimes in functions
This code will fail.
```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
// help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `x` or `y`
// help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
// | fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
// |           ++++     ++          ++          ++
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}


fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

Lifetime annotations **do not** change how long a reference lives. They describe the relationship of lifetimes of multiple references to each other. 

Updating the syntax to use lifetime annotations
```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
```
This tells rust the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid.


### Lifetime Elision
Rust follows three rules to determine if lifetime annotations are needed. 

1. The compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter that's a reference. `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32);`
2. If exactly one input parameter exist, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameter's. `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.`
3. If multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. 

Let's walk through step-by-step.
`fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {`
Apply lifetime to each parameter that's a reference
`fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {`
If exactly one input parameter exist, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameter's
`fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {`

Because there is no ambiguity, this signature will not need lifetime annotations. Let's consider another.
`fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {`
Apply lifetime to each parameter that's a reference
`fn longest<'a,'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {`
The second and third rules do not apply because `longest` has more than one input and is not a method.

Static lifetimes are special because the reference can live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals have #static lifetimes.
`let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime!";` Sometimes the compiler will suggest using a `'static` lifetime. Most of the time it is caused by dangling references or a mismatch of available lifetimes. Usually, you should fix that problem instead of using `'static` lifetimes.

Consider 
```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>( // Decalre lifetime of 'a and generic type T. They go in the same list.
    x: &'a str, // x is a string reference with lifetime of 'a
    y: &'a str, // y is a string reference with lifetime of 'a
    ann: T, // ann is of type T
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display, // T must implement the Display trait
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann); // Print ann, this is why it must use the display trait
    if x.len() > y.len() {// The compiler and us are unsure if the borrowed reference will be from x or y
		x                 // Will ensure that x and y have at least the same lifetime as the return reference 
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```
