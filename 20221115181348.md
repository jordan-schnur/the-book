# Defining and Instantiating Structs

To define a struct use the `struct` keyword. Structs should be used to store significant pieces of data that should be grouped together.  Each #field will define a type.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

To instance a struct simply fill in the values.

```rust
let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

user1.email = String::from("email2@example.com");
```

Dot notation is used to access members of the struct.

> **_NOTE:_** You can **not** only make a single member of the struct mutable, it is all or nothing. 


You can use a shorthand when using a function to build the struct to make it simpler
```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email, // is the same as email: email
        username, // is the same as username: username
```


### Struct update syntax
When needing to create a new instance that includes most but not all values from another instance you can use the struct update syntax.
```rust
let user1 = User {
	active: true,
	username: String::from("email@example.com"),
	email: String::from("another@example.com"),
	sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};

let user2 = User {
	email: String::from("another@example.com"),
	..user1
};
```

> **_NOTE ℹ️:_** Note that structs #move the data from `user1` to `user2.` You will **NOT** be able to use user1's `username` anymore because it was moved from user1 to user2. However, you can use `active` and `sign_in_count` since int and bool both implement copy.

### Tuple Structs #tuplestruct
Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the object a name, but not the individual parts. It is also useful when you want to make a tuple a different type. 

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

### Unit-Like Structs #unitlikestruct
Unit-Like structs are useful when you want to implement a #trait on a type, but don't have data to store. 
```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

### Printing Structs
In order to #print or output a struct you must opt-in via `#[derive(Debug)]`.

There are two types of output you can use;

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1); // rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
	println!("rect1 is {:#?}", rect1); // rect1 is Rectangle {
									   //     width: 30,
									   //     height: 50,
									   // }
}
```

Then: `println!("struct looks like {:?}", stuct_1);`

Another way is to use the #dbg macro. This will print the file and line number as well. dpg does takes ownership of the value, but returns it afterward. 
> **_NOTE ℹ️:_** Calling dbg will print to the standard error console (stderr) as opposed to the standard output stream (stdout).
```rust
fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&rect1);
}
```
```
[src/main.rs:10] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:14] &rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
```

For a full list of #traits see https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html

### Methods #method
Methods similar to functions, but they are defined in the context of a struct, enum or trait. Their first parameter is **always** #self

To define functions for a struct we use the implementation block (#impl).
```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

`&self` is a shorthand for `self: &Self`. Within the impl block Self is an alias for the type defined. Methods can take ownership, borrow immutable, or borrow mutably. 

You can give the method the same name as a struct's field. 
```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };
    
    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}
```
A common use case for this is for #getters. Getters are not automatically implemented.

### Automatic Referencing and Dereferencing #referencing #dereferencing
Calling a method is one place this takes place. When calling `object.something()` rust will automatically add `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so that object matches the signature of the method.
```rust
p1.distance(&p2);
(&p1).distance(&p2);
```
These are equivalent, but the first one looks much better. Given the reciver and name of a method, Rust can always figure out whether the method is reading `&self`, mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`).

### Associated Functions #associatedfunctions
All functions defined within an #impl block are associated functions because they're associated with the type named after the `impl`.
We can define an assoicated function that doesn't have `self` as the first parameter(And thus are **NOT** methods) because they are not required.

The `String::from` is an example function that's defined on the string type. Associated functions that aren't methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of a struct. They are often called `new`, but the `new` keyword is **NOT** built into Rust. 
```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
```

To call this associated function we would use the `::` syntax. `let sq = Rectangle::square(3);`.


### Multiple impl blocks #impl
Multiple `impl` blocks are valid syntax.
