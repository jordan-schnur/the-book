# 3.2 Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain #datatype or #type. Rust is a statically typed language meaning it must know of all types at compile time. 
Usually, the compiler can infer what type we want based on the value and how it is used.

### #scalar types
A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has 4 primary _scalar_ types: #int, #floating-point numbers, #bool, and #char. 

#### #int
An int is a number without a fractional component. Not(Â½ or 0.5)
Rust supports 6 int types
| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-bit | `i8` | `u8` |
| 16-bit | `i16` | `u16` |
| 32-bit | `i32` | `u32` |
| 64-bit | `i64` | `u64` |
| 128-bit | `i128` | `u128` |
| arch | `isize` | `usize` |

Each signed variant can store numbers from to $-(n^{ n - 1 })$ to $2^{ n - 1 } - 1$ inclusive where n is the number of bits. 

#### The Array Type
Array's in rust are useful when you want your data allocated on the #stack rather than the #heap. You can also ensure your data always has a fixed number of elements. If you need a flexible size array you can look at the #vector.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
Declare an array of 5 32-bit int's.

Accessing an array is done like most language. `let third = a[2];`

If trying to access an array index that is out of bounds at runtime rust will throw a 'index out of bounds' exception which prevents reading memory that is out of scope of the current array being accessed. See the following example.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

println!("Please enter an array index.");

let mut index = String::new();

io::stdin()
	.read_line(&mut index)
	.expect("Failed to read line");

let index: usize = index
	.trim()
	.parse()
	.expect("Index entered was not a number");

let element = a[index];

println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
```

```
Please enter an array index.
