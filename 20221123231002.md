# 8. Common Collections

Rust's standard library includes several of collections by default. Unlike #array or #tuple these are stored in the heap. Meaning the size does not need to be known at compile time, but it will also be slower to access. Each collection has different capabilities and cost.

The full documentation can be found here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html

## Vector
#vector
A vector can store more than one value in a single structure of a single type. 

To create a vector: `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();` An annotation is added because values are not given at compile time.
You can also use the #vecmacro to create and give values to a vector: `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`

To update a vector you use the #push method.
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new(); // Must be mut, so that it can be mutated.

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

There are to ways to get information from a vector, referencing or the #get method. 
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2]; // Will panic if no third element. Best used if you want the program to crash.
println!("The third element is {}", third);

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2); // Will not panic, best used if you want to handle the possiblity of the value null. 
match third {
	Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
	None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

Vectors follow the #ownership rules. While the following code looks logical, internally the push could cause the vector to be allocated to a new block of memory making `first` an invalid pointer.
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {}", first);
```

To #iterate over a vector you can use a #for loop.
```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
	println!("{}", i);
}
```
Also works to mutate if mut is added.
```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
	*i += 50;
}
```

If you need to store values that are different types, you can wrap them in an #enum variant. 
```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
	Int(i32),
	Float(f64),
	Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
	SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
	SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
	SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

If the types would be unknown at compile time, you can use the #trait object.

When a vector goes out of _scope_ it will also drop it's elements.
