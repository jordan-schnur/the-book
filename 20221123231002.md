# 8. Common Collections

Rust's standard library includes several of collections by default. Unlike #array or #tuple these are stored in the heap. Meaning the size does not need to be known at compile time, but it will also be slower to access. Each collection has different capabilities and cost.

The full documentation can be found here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html

## Vector
#vector
A vector can store more than one value in a single structure of a single type. 

To create a vector: `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();` An annotation is added because values are not given at compile time.
You can also use the #vecmacro to create and give values to a vector: `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];`

To update a vector you use the #push method.
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new(); // Must be mut, so that it can be mutated.

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

There are to ways to get information from a vector, referencing or the #get method. 
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2]; // Will panic if no third element. Best used if you want the program to crash.
println!("The third element is {}", third);

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2); // Will not panic, best used if you want to handle the possiblity of the value null. 
match third {
	Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
	None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

Vectors follow the #ownership rules. While the following code looks logical, internally the push could cause the vector to be allocated to a new block of memory making `first` an invalid pointer.
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {}", first);
```

To #iterate over a vector you can use a #for loop.
```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
	println!("{}", i);
}
```
Also works to mutate if mut is added.
```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
	*i += 50;
}
```

If you need to store values that are different types, you can wrap them in an #enum variant. 
```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
	Int(i32),
	Float(f64),
	Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
	SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
	SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
	SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

If the types would be unknown at compile time, you can use the #trait object.

When a vector goes out of _scope_ it will also drop it's elements.


## String
#string

There are three common problems with strings when moving to rust, Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and UTF-8.

Strings in Rust are implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods that provide functionality when the bytes are interpreted as text. 

Rust has a single string type, which is the `str` string slice type. It is usually borrowed with `&str`.

A string literal `""` is stored in the programs binary and is a string slice.
On the other hand, a String type is provided by Rust's standard library (Not coded into the core language), and is growable, mutable, owned, and UTF-8 encoded.

To create a mutable string: `let mut s = String::new();`

To create a string for a string literal we can use the `to_string`
```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```
We could have used `let s = String::from("initial contents");` to achieve the same result.

You can append to a string by using `s.push_str("string")` It does not take ownership of the string.
You can push a single character by using the `s.push('l')` method. 

To #concat to strings you can use the `+` operator. Keep in mind ownership.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

Underlying the `+` operator is the `add` method. The signature looks like `fn add(self, s: &str) -> String`.

`s2` has an `&`, meaning it is a reference of the second string. We can only add a `&str` and to a `String`; we can not add two `String` together. `s2` is a `&String` and is #coerce(d) into a `&str`. When using the `add` method Rust uses #derefcoercion, which in this case turns `&s2` into `&s2[]`. Add does not take ownership of the `s` parameter, meaning `s2` is still valid after the operation. However, `add` does take ownership of `self`, meaning it takes ownership of `s1` in this case and will no longer be valid.

Using the `+` operator to concat multiple strings can have unintended results. Instead it is better to use the #format macro. It uses references so that it does not take ownership of any of it's parameters.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3); // does not take ownership of s1, s2, or s3
```

Rust does **not** support indexing of strings. IE: `let c = s[2];` which will throw an **_error_** `String cannot be indexed by {integer}` 
This is the case because String is a wrapper for `Vec<u8>`. Strings can be looked at in three different ways, bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters. All three would be valid use cases, and when supporting UTF-8 you can not ensure that one byte is a single character.

Instead, Rust allows you to index with a range `let tic = &s[0...3]`. However, if this is out of _bounds_ it will **crash** your program. 

If you want to iterate of char in a string, you can use the for loop as such:
```rust
for c in "Зд".chars() { // You can also use .bytes() // 208 151 208 180
    println!("{}", c);
}
// З
// д
```

Strings are complex, and require you to be thoughtful about their use. 
## Hash Map
#hashmap

A hashmap (`HashMap<K, V>`) is a mapping of type `K` to values of type `V` using a hashing function which determines where to store these values in memory. Hash maps are homogeneous, all keys must have the same type, and all values must have the same type.

You can create a hashmap using the `HashMap::new()` method, but you must include it via the `use` keyword `use std::collections::HashMap` You can then insert by using the `insert` method `scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10)` which adds a record as `Blue => 10`. 
You can then fetch the value by using the `get` method.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);
```
This code will get _Blue_ teams score. `get` returns an `Option<&V>`, if there is no value for the key, it will return #none. The program calls #copied to get an `Option<i32>` instead of `Option<&i32>`, then unwrap_or to set score to zero if scores doesn't have an entry for the key(Returns none).

To iterate over an entire hashmap we can use a `for` loop. This will print the results in an arbitrary order. 
```rust
for (key, value) in &scores {
	println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

For values that implement the #copy trait (like i32) the values will be copied into the hash map; meaning the original values will still be available. However, other items such as `String` will be moved and the hashmap will be the owner of the values.
```rust
let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point,if used "value borrowed here after move"
```

However if changed to `map.insert(field_name, &field_value);`, you can continue to use it. However, it must have valid for at least as long as the hap map is valid.

To overwrite an existing value, you can simple insert on the same key.

To check if a key already exist in the hash map, you can use the `entry` method.
```rust
let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50); // Will insert 50 under Yellow
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50); // Will see that Blue exist, and keep the value of 10.

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
	let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0); // Returns 0 or value based on word existing
	*count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```

### Enumerate
#enumerate You can use `enumerate` to loop over an iterator with the index.

```rust
for (i, word) in str.split_whitespace().enumerate() {
	println!("word {}: {}", i, word);

	for char in word.chars() {
		println!("Char: {}", char);
	}
}
```
