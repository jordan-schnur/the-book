# Introduction
These files will be my personal notes while following along in the [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

### Why use rust?
Rust uses a smart compiler that plays gatekeeper and refuses to compile when encountering many of the common bugs that plague low level development. 

### How to use this book?
Read the book in sequence. Later chapters will build on previous ones. 
There are two types of chapters. **Concept** chapters and **project** chapters. Concept chapters will introduce new aspects of Rust. Project chapters will apply what you've learned by building a small project. Project chapters are 2, 12, and 20. The rest are concept chapters.
