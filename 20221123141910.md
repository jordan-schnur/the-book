# 6. Enums and Pattern Matching


### What is an enum?
An #enum allows you to define a type by enumerating it's possible #variants. 

### Defining an enum
```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
	V4,
	V6
}

// To define a varible
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

An enum can also hold a value
```rust
enum IpAddr {
	V4(String),
	V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

Enum's can also hold different types and ammounts of associated data.

```rust
enum IpAddr {
	V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
	V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

You can also define methods on enums using the #impl keyword. They work the same way as structs.

### Options
An #option type encodes a common scenario in which a value could be something or nothing. Rust does not contain a #null feature that is common in other languages. `Null` is a **value** that mean there is no value there. A benefit of this is that the compiler can ensure the code is handling all possible scenarios. 

Option is defined in the standard library as follows:
```rust
enum Option<T> {
	None,
	Some(T),
}
```

Option is included in the #prelude and does not need to be brought into scope to use it. 
```rust
let some_number = Some(5); // Type: Option<i32>
let some_char = Some('e'); // Type: Option<char>

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None; // Type: Option:<i32>
```
Because the compiler can not infer the type of `absent_number` based on the value, it must be given.

Consider the following example: 
```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

let sum = x + y; // Throws ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option<i8>`
```

To fix this issue we can use the many methods available in the Option type. You can view them all here. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html

A bad way to fix this issue is:
#example1
```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

if y.is_some() {
	let sum = x + y.unwrap();
	println!("Sum: {sum}");
}
```

#match is a much better solution.

## The #match Control Flow Construct
Matching aloows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. #Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards and many other things. Each pattern is called an #arm.

`Match` may seem similar to the `if` statement, however `if` statements **must** return a boolean type, while `match` can return any type.

Consider the following: 
```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1, // First arm says if value_in_cents(Coin::Penny) => 1
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

If the return value of an arm is short, curly brackets are not necessary, however if you want to run multiple lines of code it is required.
```rust
match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny!");
            1
		}
...
```

### Patterns that Bind to Values
Consider the following example where an enum variant holds data inside of it:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

//Update function to handle new case
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 2,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```

In the #example1 we could have written the output much more cleanly as 
```rust
fn add_two_num(x: i32, y: Option<i32>) -> i32 {
    match y {
        None => {
            println!("Could not add the two numbers succcesfully.");
            x
        }
        Some(i) => x + y.unwrap(),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sum = add_two_num(1, None);
    println!("x + y = {sum}");
}
```

Matches must be an exhaustive list of possibilities and cover all scenarios. 

You can use default values to catch possibilities that do not have a special case. You can catch the value and do something with it, or use `_` to throw it away.

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
	3 => add_fancy_hat(),
	7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
	other => move_player(other), //In this case it is called other, but can be named anything.
}
```

```rust
 let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
	3 => add_fancy_hat(),
	7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
	_ => reroll(), // still caught, but value not needed.
}
```

We can also use the tuple type as a return value so rust knows explictly that we aren't going to use any other value that doesn't match a pattern earlier arm.
```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
	3 => add_fancy_hat(),
	7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
	_ => (),
}
```
