# 3.4 Control Flow

Control flow conditionally run code based on an expression being true or continue in a loop while an expression is true.

#### #if Expressions
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```
This code will check if number is less than 5. If less than 5 the code will run the first #arms, if greater than five will run the second arm. 

The if statement **MUST** evaluate a bool or it will throw an error. Rust will not typecase from other values into a #bool. 


You can also use if in a #let statement
```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
The number variable will be bound based on the condition variable. However, if the if and #else statement have different types an error will occur. 

### Loops loop, while, and for

#### #loop
Will run a block of code repeatedly while condition is true. 
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```
Print `again!` forever.

A valuable use for loop is to retry an operation you know might fail. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

When `counter` reaches 10, it will break out of the loop and return `counter * 2`. We can therefore print it and the output would be `The result is 20`.

####  #looplabels
You can optionally specify labels for loops for use in with the #break or #continue keywords.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```
The first `break` doesn't specify a label and will exit the inner loop only. The `break 'counting_up'` will exit the outer loop. 


#### #while loops
While possible to implement the behavior of while loops using `loop` you can save time and brain power by using the while loop. It will continue running while the condition remains true. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

#### #for loops
You can use while loops to loop over an element collection such as an #array. However, a for loop will sav etime.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```
